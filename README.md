# OECD Visualization

## Context
Visualization is a powerful tool for both exploring data and presenting analyzed data to end users. 
In this project, a data visualization has been developed to support the exploration, comparison, and analysis of data related to the quality of life in various countries worldwide. 
This visualization is part of an online project designed to engage the general public in exploring and understanding global human well-being and is accessible as an HTML page.

The visualization utilizes data from the OECD Better Life Index, which measures well-being across multiple areas in OECD countries. For more information on the OECD Better Life Index, visit OECD Better Life Index.

The dataset includes measures for 38 OECD countries and 3 non-OECD countries across 24 indicators grouped into 11 topic areas: Housing, Income, Jobs, Community, Education, Environment, Civic Engagement, Health, Life Satisfaction, Safety, and Work-Life Balance. 
The data has been carefully wrangled, and additional data from other public sources have been incorporated to enhance the visualization.
